Fork of Sam Collett's (http://www.texotela.co.uk) jQuery newsTicker plugin (http://github.com/SamWM/jQuery-Plugins) with little improvements.

Differences from original:
* Plugin can be applied not only for ul/li elements (children elements could be setted through selector passed as argument)
* NewsTicker won't start if there are less than 2 children elements
